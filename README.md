# Fabric-Java-Client(No longer maintained)
# This client has an anti pattern, it assumes to have different instance of CAClientWrapper class for each enrolled user. CAClientWrapper class should be singleton. It should be instantiated only once.

A more detailed explanation is available on [medium](https://codeburst.io/a-concise-tutorial-on-working-with-hyperledger-fabric-java-sdk-a6f11d8bb5b0)

A Hyperledger fabric Java client.
This tutorial uses connection profile in order to simplify the process of getting access to fabric network.

<b><u>Prerequsite:</u></b>

<b>1. Fabric network:</b> A running fabric network. See [this](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/build_network.html) tutorial to quickly bootstrap a network. To practice on this client, my recommendation would be to start a network on <b>IBM Blockchain Platform</b>. It enables fast and easy setup of a multi-org blockchain network and yes, it is free of cost under Starter plan.
[Here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/starter_plan.html#overview) is a how you can set up a blockchain network in minutes.

<b>2. A chain code:</b> A sample chain code(written in Golang) is provided under config/chaincode/ directory. You have options to write your own.

<b>3. Connection profile:</b> The application will load a network <b>connection profile </b>(/src/com/fabric/config/network-config.json) file and then it will be used by fabric java client to simplify the steps needed to set up and use the network. The connection profile has specific addresses and settings of network items.
If your network runs on IBM Blockchain platform, then <b>Connection Profile</b> can be downloaded as shown here:

A sample connection profile has been provided under directory /src/com/fabric/config/.
A detailed documentation on how to create a connection profile for your network is available [here.](
https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/reference/connectionprofile)

<b>4. Buildpath dependencies:</b> If face any issue with Maven setup, download <b>fabric-sdk-java-1.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar</b> from [maven repo](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/1.1.0/) and add it to your build path.


### Setting up client:

<b>Step 1: Enrolling admin:</b>

When we bootstrapped our blockchain network, an admin user was <b>registered</b> with the MSP provider, fabric-ca server in our case.
Now we need user-context of the admin user for our client to perform operations on blockchain network. We need to send an enrol call to CA server and retrieve the enrollment certificate(long-term identity) for the admin. Later on,
we will use this enrollment certificate to construct admin's user-context.
To make the enrol call, we require an identity(username), admin, in this case, its secret key and a ca-client. If you are using one of the samples, then the secret key would be adminpw. The secret key for network running on the IBM cloud platform can be found inside the connection profile:- under 'registrar' object, find 'enrollId' and 'enrollSecret' property.

```Java
   public void enrollAdmin(String name, String secret) throws Exception {
        UserContext adminContext;

        //read admin context from client's msp folder
        adminContext = Util.readUserContext(org, name);
        if (adminContext != null) {

            //admin context found; admin is already enrolled.
            return;
        }

        //HFCA Client makes an enrol request to ca server.
        Enrollment enrollment = hfcaClient.enroll(name, secret);

        //construct admin context
        adminContext = new UserContext();
        adminContext.setName(name);
        adminContext.setEnrollment(enrollment);
        adminContext.setAffiliation(LoadConnectionProfile.getOrgInfo(org).getName());
        adminContext.setMspId(LoadConnectionProfile.getOrgInfo(org).getMspId());

        //store admin context in msp folder
        Util.writeUserContext(adminContext);

    }
```

On successful enrolment, admin user context will be saved under MSP folder.

<b>Step 2: Registering and enrolling user:</b>
Now, of course, we would not like to use this admin user to invoke all transaction on blockchain network. We may require access control decisions in our chaincode based on the attributes of the identity of the client (i.e. the invoker of the chain code), called [ABAC](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/users-guide.html#attribute-based-access-control) in short. so the whole point here is to enable other users to interact with the network and this is a two-step process:
- 1. <b>Register the user with CA:</b>

     The identity performing the registration, admin in our case, must be already enrolled and have proper access rights. As we have already enrolled admin in step 1, we would use admin(registrar) user-context to register new users.

```Java
     public void registerUser(String userName, String registrarAdmin){
        UserContext userContext;

        //read user context from msp folder
        userContext = Util.readUserContext(org, userName);
        if (userContext != null) {
            //user is already registered and enrolled, do nothing.
            return;
        }

        //User is not registered, construct a registeration request
        RegistrationRequest regRequest = new RegistrationRequest(userName, org);

        //Reterive registrar(admin) usercontext from msp folder
        UserContext registrarContext = Util.readUserContext(org, registrarAdmin);

        //HFCA Client sends a registration request for the user with admin as registrar
        String enrollSecret = hfcaClient.register(regRequest, registrarContext);
        .
        .
        //If registration is successful, in return we will get a secret key for the registered user. We will use the secret key to enrol TJ with the client in the next step.

```

- 2. <b>Enrol user:</b>
```Java

        // HFCA Client makes enrol call to ca server
        Enrollment enrollment = hfcaClient.enroll(userName, enrollSecret);

        // create user context for enrolled user
        userContext = new UserContext();
        userContext.setMspId(LoadConnectionProfile.getOrgInfo(org).getMspId());
        userContext.setAffiliation(org); //organization user belongs to
        userContext.setEnrollment(enrollment);
        userContext.setName(userName);

        // Save user context in MSP folder.
        Util.writeUserContext(userContext);
        }
```

On successful enrolment, user-context for the enrolled user would be saved in the client's MSP folder.

<b>The Client is ready to invoke and query chaincode on fabric network </b>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Invoking a Transaction:
Hyperledger fabric follows <b>execute - order - validate - commit</b> paradigm.
Each INVOKE operation is completed in three phases:
- Execution Phase:- In the execution phase, client prepares and send a transaction proposal to endorsing peers. A transaction proposal mainly contains - the identity of submitting client and a payload in the form of chaincode operation name, parameters and chaincode identifier. Endorser simulates the proposal and returns a response proposal (endorsement). Client collects the endorsements and if endorsement policy is satisfied, creates a request for ordering phase.

```Java
public CompletableFuture<BlockEvent.TransactionEvent> invokeChainCode(String channelName, String
            chaincodeName, String fcn, String[] args) {
        try {
            // loads channel configuration consisting of endorsing peers, orderers, event hubs, etc            
            channel = fc.getChannelClient(channelName);
            
            // get identity of invoker
            UserContext userContext = CAClientWrapper.getUserContext(this.userName, this.org);
            
            // Construct a transaction proposal
            TransactionProposalRequest transactionProposalRequest = TransactionProposalRequest.newInstance(userContext);
            transactionProposalRequest.setChaincodeID(ChaincodeID.newBuilder().setName(chaincodeName).build()); //chaincode identifier
            transactionProposalRequest.setFcn(fcn); //operation name
            transactionProposalRequest.setArgs(args); //arguments list
            transactionProposalRequest.setProposalWaitTime(110000);
            
            // Optional info can be used by the chaincode during initialization, but not saved in the ledger, such as cryptographic material
            Map<String, byte[]> tm = new HashMap<>();
            tm.put("HyperLedgerFabric", "Java - SDK".getBytes(UTF_8));
            tm.put("method", fcn.getBytes(UTF_8));
            transactionProposalRequest.setTransientMap(tm);

            // endorsements verification
            Collection<ProposalResponse> response = channel.sendTransactionProposal(transactionProposalRequest);
            for (ProposalResponse resp : response) {
                ChaincodeResponse.Status status = resp.getStatus();
                Logger.getLogger(ChannelWrapper.class.getName()).log(Level.INFO, "Invoked chaincode " + chaincodeName + " - " + fcn + ". Status - " + status);

                if (status.getStatus() != 200) {
                    throw new Exception(resp.getMessage());
                }
            }
            
            // verify that all endorser returned same proposal payload (readset/writeset)
            Collection<Set<ProposalResponse>> proposalConsistencySets = SDKUtils.getProposalConsistencySets(response);
            if (proposalConsistencySets.size() != 1) {

                throw new Exception("Expected only one set of consistent proposal responses but got more");
            }

```

- Ordering Phase:- Client submits the transaction to orderer after it has collected enough endorsements. Orderer batch the transaction in blocks and atomically broadcasts to all peers.

```Java
// submit transaction to Orderer
 commitResp = channel.sendTransaction(response, userContext);
 
 //add block listener <todo>
```


- Validation Phase:- In this phase, peer collects the block and performs (sequentially):
 
  - Validating endorsements against endorsement policy evaluation.
  - A read-write version check:- version of the key in the readset should match to those in the current state
  - Ledger update phase:- blocks are appended to the ledger.

#### The other two features supported by this client are:
- Querying peer ledger
- Get transaction details

ChannelWrapper class is extensible and more operations can be added if required.
